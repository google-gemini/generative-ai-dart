## Getting Started

To try these samples out, follow these steps:

- To use the Gemini API, you'll need an API key. If you don't already have one, 
  create a key in Google AI Studio: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Export a `$GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable with an API key with access to
  the Gemini generative models, or run the below commands with an environment
  containing this variable.
- Run any sample from the `bin` directory (e.g., `dart bin/simple_text.dart`).
